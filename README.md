All files are related to Packet Tracer. This will showcase all the homeworks and labs that I have done as part of CSCE4535, a class titled "Introduction to Network Administration."

If you need a password to get into any of the routers/switches presented in these labs, the password is "cisco". The "enable" command will also need the password "cisco" in order for that command to be ran.
